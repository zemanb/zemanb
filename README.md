ðŸ”’ Private Projects  
As a software developer at Epic, where I worked on projects that improved patient care and streamlined healthcare workflows. While I am not able to share the code for these projects, I gained valuable experience in software development during my time at Epic. 
If you would like to see some of my projects that I am unable to publish the code for, please visit [this page](https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/archive/). These projects include a [euchre game](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/) and a [message board post classification algorithm]([https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p4-web/)).
