ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben Zeman!  
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with an eagerness for problem-solving and an interest in data science. My academic background in Physics, Mathematics, and machine learning, along with my professional software engineering experience, has provided me with effective technical and troubleshooting skills. My collaborative work with othersâ€”both in academic and professional experiencesâ€”has enhanced and expanded my interpersonal skills. I use my commitment to supporting team success, strong analytical instincts, and programming techniques to create efficient solutions in complex, data-rich environments.  

Here, you will find examples of projects where I've applied the above skills. Feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn for any opportunities in software engineering, data science, and integrations of both fields.

ðŸ”’ Private Projects  
As a software engineer at Epic, I've worked on projects that improved patient care and streamlined healthcare workflows. While I am not able to share the code for these projects, I've gained valuable experience in development, design, project management, and additional skills/tasks during my time at Epic.   
If you would like to see some of my computer science projects that I am unable to publish the code for, please visit [this page](https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/archive/). These projects include a [euchre game](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/) and a [message board post classification algorithm](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p4-web/).
